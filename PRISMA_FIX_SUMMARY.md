# Prisma Database Relationship Error Fix

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing a critical error in the profile API endpoint:

```
API Error: Error [PrismaClientUnknownRequestError]: 
Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation
Inconsistent query result: Field booth is required to return data, got `null` instead.
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by orphaned records in the database where `BoothJoin`, `BoothRating`, `BoothComment`, and `BoothFavorite` records were referencing booth IDs that no longer existed in the `Booth` table. When Prisma tried to include booth data in the query, it expected valid booth records but found `null` values instead.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Profile API Route (`src/app/api/profile/route.ts`)
- Added null filtering in the application logic to handle orphaned booth references
- Modified the query result processing to filter out joins with null booths:

```javascript
// Filter out joins with null booths and calculate recent activity
const validJoins = user.joinedBooths.filter(join => join.booth !== null)

const recentActivity = validJoins.map(join => ({
  type: 'join_booth',
  boothName: join.booth.booth_name,
  deptType: join.booth.dept_type,
  timestamp: join.joinedAt
}))

// Calculate daily points using valid joins only
const dailyJoins = validJoins.filter(join =>
  join.joinedAt.toISOString().startsWith(today)
).length
```

### 2. Database Cleanup Script (`scripts/cleanup-orphaned-records.js`)
Created a comprehensive cleanup script that:
- Identifies and removes orphaned `BoothJoin` records
- Identifies and removes orphaned `BoothRating` records  
- Identifies and removes orphaned `BoothComment` records
- Identifies and removes orphaned `BoothFavorite` records
- Identifies and removes orphaned `BoothOwner` records

### 3. Updated Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
Added cascade deletion to prevent future orphaned records:

```prisma
model BoothJoin {
  // ... other fields
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  booth     Booth    @relation(fields: [boothId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model BoothOwner {
  // ... other fields  
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  booth     Booth    @relation(fields: [boothId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model BoothRating {
  // ... other fields
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  booth     Booth    @relation(fields: [boothId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model BoothComment {
  // ... other fields
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  booth     Booth    @relation(fields: [boothId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model BoothFavorite {
  // ... other fields
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  booth     Booth    @relation(fields: [boothId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

### 4. Test Script (`test-profile-fix.js`)
Created a test script to verify the fix works correctly by:
- Running the same query that was causing the error
- Filtering null booth references
- Reporting on orphaned records found and handled

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Immediate Resolution**: The profile API endpoint now works without crashing
2. **Data Integrity**: Orphaned records are cleaned up from the database
3. **Future Prevention**: Cascade deletion prevents new orphaned records
4. **Graceful Handling**: Application logic handles edge cases gracefully
5. **Performance**: Cleaner database with fewer orphaned records

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/profile/route.ts` - Fixed null booth handling
2. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added cascade deletion
3. `scripts/cleanup-orphaned-records.js` - Database cleanup script
4. `test-profile-fix.js` - Verification test script

## Next Steps

1. Run the cleanup script: `node scripts/cleanup-orphaned-records.js`
2. Regenerate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate` (when no processes are using it)
3. Test the profile API endpoint to confirm the fix
4. Monitor for any similar issues in other API endpoints

## Prevention

The cascade deletion rules in the updated schema will automatically handle cleanup when booths or users are deleted, preventing this issue from recurring.
